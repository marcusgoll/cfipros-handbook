# Airfoil Theory and Design

## Introduction

The wing's shape, called an airfoil, is fundamental to generating lift. Understanding how different airfoil designs affect lift production will help you understand aircraft performance and limitations.

## What is an Airfoil?

An airfoil is the cross-sectional shape of a wing, viewed from the side. This shape is specifically designed to generate lift when air flows over it.

### Key Airfoil Components

- **Leading Edge**: The front of the airfoil where air first contacts the wing
- **Trailing Edge**: The rear of the airfoil where air leaves the wing
- **Chord Line**: An imaginary straight line from leading edge to trailing edge
- **Camber**: The curvature of the airfoil's upper and lower surfaces
- **Thickness**: The maximum distance between upper and lower surfaces

## How Lift is Generated

Lift generation involves both **Bernoulli's Principle** and **Newton's Laws of Motion**:

### Bernoulli's Principle
- Air moving faster over the curved upper surface creates lower pressure
- Higher pressure below the wing pushes upward
- **Pressure differential** creates lift force

### Newton's Third Law
- Wing deflects air downward (action)
- Air pushes wing upward (reaction)
- **Equal and opposite reaction** creates lift

## Airfoil Characteristics

### Camber Effects
- **Positive Camber**: Upper surface more curved than lower
  - Increases lift coefficient
  - Higher stall angle
  - More drag at high speeds
  
- **Symmetric Airfoil**: Equal curvature top and bottom
  - Zero lift at zero angle of attack
  - Used on aerobatic aircraft
  - Less drag, but requires higher angle of attack for lift

### Thickness Ratio
- **Thick Airfoils** (&gt;15% thickness/chord):
  - More lift at low speeds
  - Lower critical Mach number
  - More structural strength
  
- **Thin Airfoils** (&lt;12% thickness/chord):
  - Better high-speed performance
  - Higher critical Mach number
  - Less lift at low speeds

## Angle of Attack vs. Lift

The relationship between angle of attack and lift follows a predictable pattern:

1. **Small angles** (0-10°): Lift increases steadily
2. **Moderate angles** (10-15°): Lift continues to increase but at slower rate
3. **Critical angle** (~17-20°): Maximum lift coefficient reached
4. **Beyond critical**: Stall occurs, lift decreases dramatically

## Types of Airfoils

### Training Aircraft
- **Clark Y**: Simple, stable, forgiving stall characteristics
- **NACA 2412**: 2% camber, good all-around performance

### High-Performance Aircraft
- **Laminar flow airfoils**: Reduced drag at cruise speeds
- **Supercritical airfoils**: Delay shock wave formation

### Specialized Applications
- **Helicopter rotors**: Symmetric, designed for changing angle of attack
- **Propellers**: Twisted airfoil optimized for rotational motion

## Practical Applications

Understanding airfoil theory helps pilots:
- **Predict stall behavior**: Gentle vs. sharp stall characteristics
- **Understand performance**: Why some aircraft climb better, others cruise faster
- **Manage angle of attack**: Stay within safe operating limits
- **Choose appropriate aircraft**: For specific mission requirements

## Key Takeaways

- Airfoil shape directly affects lift generation and aircraft performance
- Both Bernoulli's principle and Newton's laws explain lift
- Camber and thickness ratio determine airfoil characteristics
- Angle of attack must stay below critical angle to avoid stall
- Different airfoil designs optimize for different flight regimes

## Next Steps

In the next lesson, **Angle of Attack**, we'll explore how changing the wing's angle relative to the airflow affects lift production and aircraft control.
