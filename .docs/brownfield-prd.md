### Goals and Background Context

#### Goals

- Create production-ready Interactive Pilot Handbook PWA matching comprehensive PRD specifications
- Implement 10+ custom interactive aviation components with 60fps performance
- Deliver offline-first architecture with full feature parity
- Achieve <3s load times and >90 Lighthouse scores across all categories
- Implement secure payment processing and content access control
- Establish scalable MDX content management system
- Create accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA) learning platform

#### Background Context

The Interactive Pilot Handbook addresses a critical gap in aviation education technology. Traditional pilot training materials are static, expensive ($200-300), and lack interactive elements that help students understand complex aviation concepts. This project creates a modern, interactive, and affordable alternative using cutting-edge web technologies.

The comprehensive PRD (607 lines) and UI Analysis (469 lines) provide exceptional planning foundation. The project targets Private, Instrument, and Commercial pilot certification students with visual learning elements similar to Cartesian.app for computer science education.
