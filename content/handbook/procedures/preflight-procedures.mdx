# Preflight Procedures - Comprehensive Guide

## Overview

Preflight procedures are critical safety protocols that must be completed before every flight. These systematic checks ensure aircraft airworthiness, weather conditions, and pilot readiness for safe flight operations.

## Pre-Flight Planning

### 1. Weather Analysis

<DefinitionBox term="Weather Briefing">
A comprehensive review of current and forecast weather conditions along the route of flight, including departure, en route, and destination weather.
</DefinitionBox>

**Required Weather Information:**

- Current conditions (METAR)
- Forecast conditions (TAF)
- Winds aloft
- NOTAM information
- Pilot reports (PIREP)
- Radar and satellite imagery

### 2. Flight Planning

**Essential Planning Elements:**

- Route selection and alternates
- Fuel requirements (including reserves)
- Performance calculations
- Weight and balance
- Required equipment verification

<QuickRefTable>
| Flight Type | Fuel Reserve (VFR) | Fuel Reserve (IFR) |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Day | 30 minutes | 45 minutes |
| Night | 45 minutes | 45 minutes |
| Alternate Required | N/A | 45 min + alternate |
</QuickRefTable>

## Aircraft Inspection

### External Inspection

**Systematic Approach:**

1. **Cockpit Preparation**
   - Master switch OFF
   - Ignition OFF
   - Fuel selector OFF
   - Controls checked

2. **Left Wing**
   - Wing structure and skin
   - Fuel tank and cap
   - Pitot tube (if equipped)
   - Navigation lights
   - Stall warning system

3. **Engine Compartment**
   - Oil level and condition
   - Fuel lines and connections
   - Engine mount
   - Propeller and spinner

4. **Right Wing**
   - Mirror left wing inspection
   - Fuel quantity and quality
   - Control surface operation

5. **Empennage**
   - Rudder and elevator
   - Trim tab operation
   - Antennas and lights

### Internal Inspection

**Cockpit Checks:**

- Required documents (ARROW)
- Flight controls operation
- Instruments and avionics
- Emergency equipment
- Passenger briefing items

<RegulatoryText>
91.103 Preflight action: Each pilot in command shall, before beginning a flight, become familiar with all available information concerning that flight.
</RegulatoryText>

## Documentation Requirements

### Required Documents (ARROW)

<DefinitionBox term="ARROW">
Mnemonic for required aircraft documents:
- **A**irworthiness Certificate
- **R**egistration Certificate  
- **R**adio Station License (if required)
- **O**perator's Manual
- **W**eight and Balance Data
</DefinitionBox>

### Pilot Requirements

**Before Each Flight:**

- Valid pilot certificate
- Current medical certificate
- Government-issued photo ID
- Current flight review (if required)
- Currency requirements met

## Weather Minimums

### VFR Minimums

<QuickRefTable>
| Airspace | Visibility | Cloud Clearance |
|----------|------------|-----------------|
| Class A | N/A | N/A |
| Class B | 3 SM | Clear of clouds |
| Class C | 3 SM | 500' below, 1000' above, 2000' horizontal |
| Class D | 3 SM | 500' below, 1000' above, 2000' horizontal |
| Class E (surface) | 3 SM | 500' below, 1000' above, 2000' horizontal |
| Class E (1200' AGL) | 1 SM | 500' below, 1000' above, 2000' horizontal |
| Class G (surface) | 1 SM | Clear of clouds |
</QuickRefTable>

## Emergency Preparedness

### Emergency Equipment Check

**Required Items:**

- Fire extinguisher (if required)
- Emergency locator transmitter (ELT)
- First aid kit
- Emergency procedures checklist
- Survival gear (extended flights)

### Emergency Procedures Review

**Pre-Flight Briefing Should Include:**

- Emergency landing procedures
- Fire/smoke procedures
- Electrical failure procedures
- Communication failure procedures
- Passenger evacuation procedures

## Passenger Briefing

### Required Briefing Items

<RegulatoryText>
91.519 Passenger briefing: Before each takeoff, each pilot in command shall ensure that all passengers have been orally briefed on the following:
</RegulatoryText>

**Safety Briefing Elements:**

- Smoking restrictions
- Seatbelt/shoulder harness use
- Location of exits
- Emergency procedures
- Oxygen equipment (if required)

## Common Preflight Errors

### Critical Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Inadequate Weather Analysis**
   - Skipping forecast review
   - Ignoring NOTAM information
   - Underestimating weather changes

2. **Incomplete Aircraft Inspection**
   - Rushing through checklist
   - Missing fuel contamination
   - Overlooking control surface damage

3. **Documentation Oversights**
   - Expired certificates
   - Missing required documents
   - Inadequate flight planning

## Teaching Preflight Procedures

### For Flight Instructors

**Key Teaching Points:**

- Systematic approach importance
- Risk management principles
- Regulatory compliance
- Professional habits development

**Common Student Errors:**

- Rushing through procedures
- Inconsistent inspection patterns
- Poor weather interpretation
- Inadequate documentation review

## Seasonal Considerations

### Winter Operations

**Additional Checks:**

- Ice and frost removal
- Preheating requirements
- Cold weather starting procedures
- Runway conditions

### Summer Operations

**Hot Weather Considerations:**

- Density altitude effects
- Fuel expansion
- Engine cooling
- Passenger comfort

## Technology Integration

### Modern Tools

**Electronic Flight Bags (EFB):**

- Digital charts and approach plates
- Weather integration
- Flight planning capabilities
- Document storage

**Weather Apps:**

- Real-time radar
- METAR/TAF integration
- Pilot reports
- Forecast models

## Conclusion

Thorough preflight procedures are the foundation of safe flight operations. As aviation professionals, developing and maintaining systematic preflight habits protects passengers, aircraft, and the pilot's certificate.

Remember: **Every flight begins on the ground with proper preparation.**
