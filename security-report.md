## Critical Vulnerabilities

### 1. Hardcoded Secrets in Version Control
- **Location**: `.env` file (lines 7, 10, 30)
- **Description**: Production API keys and secrets are hardcoded in the `.env` file that is tracked by Git, exposing sensitive credentials.
- **Impact**: Complete compromise of Clerk authentication, PostHog analytics, and database access. Attackers can impersonate users, access all data, and potentially pivot to other systems.
- **Remediation Checklist**:
  - [ ] Move all secrets to `.env.local` file (not tracked by Git)
  - [ ] Add `.env.local` to `.gitignore` if not already present
  - [ ] Rotate all exposed credentials immediately:
    - [ ] Generate new Clerk publishable and secret keys
    - [ ] Generate new PostHog API key
    - [ ] Update database credentials
  - [ ] Remove hardcoded secrets from `.env` file
  - [ ] Audit Git history and remove exposed secrets from previous commits
  - [ ] Implement environment variable validation in production deployments

### 2. Missing Authorization in Admin Endpoints
- **Location**: `src/app/api/admin/resources/route.ts` (lines 36-45)
- **Description**: Admin authorization relies solely on user metadata without proper validation or role-based access control implementation.
- **Impact**: Privilege escalation attacks allowing regular users to access admin functionality, modify resources, and view sensitive analytics data.
- **Remediation Checklist**:
  - [ ] Implement proper role-based access control (RBAC) system
  - [ ] Add server-side role validation middleware
  - [ ] Implement admin role assignment process with proper audit trail
  - [ ] Add rate limiting to admin endpoints
  - [ ] Implement session-based admin verification with time limits
  - [ ] Add logging for all admin actions
- **References**: [OWASP A01:2021 – Broken Access Control](https://owasp.org/Top10/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/)

### 3. SQL Injection Risk in Database Queries
- **Location**: `src/app/api/feedback/route.ts` (lines 95-100)
- **Description**: User-provided `pageId` parameter is used directly in database queries without proper parameterization validation.
- **Impact**: Potential SQL injection attacks leading to data breach, data manipulation, or complete database compromise.
- **Remediation Checklist**:
  - [ ] Implement input validation for all query parameters
  - [ ] Use parameterized queries exclusively (already using Drizzle ORM, ensure proper usage)
  - [ ] Add input sanitization middleware

### 4. Insufficient File Upload Validation
- **Location**: `src/app/api/acs-extractor/upload/route.ts` (lines 49-71)
- **Description**: File upload validation only checks MIME type and size, which can be easily bypassed. No content validation or malware scanning implemented.

- **Remediation Checklist**:
  - [ ] Implement file content validation (magic number verification)
  - [ ] Add virus/malware scanning for uploaded files

### 5. Information Disclosure in Error Responses
- **Location**: `src/lib/error-handling.ts` (lines 252-258)
- **Description**: Error handling only filters sensitive details for 500 errors, but other error codes may still expose sensitive information including stack traces and internal system details.
- **Impact**: Information leakage could assist attackers in reconnaissance, revealing system architecture, database schema, and internal implementation details.
- **Remediation Checklist**:
  - [ ] Implement generic error messages for all client-facing responses
  - [ ] Remove stack traces from production error responses
  - [ ] Implement error code mapping to safe, generic messages
