## Emergency Procedures

### CSP Violation Spike

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - [ ] Check application logs for CSP violations
   - [ ] Review recent deployments or changes
   - [ ] Switch to CSP report-only mode if needed
   - [ ] Document violation patterns

2. **Investigation**:
   - [ ] Identify source of violations
   - [ ] Check for malicious script injection
   - [ ] Review third-party integrations
   - [ ] Analyze user-reported issues

3. **Resolution**:
   - [ ] Update CSP directives if legitimate
   - [ ] Remove malicious content if found
   - [ ] Deploy security fixes
   - [ ] Monitor for continued violations

### Security Header Failure

1. **Detection**:
   - [ ] Monitor health check endpoint alerts
   - [ ] Check Railway deployment logs
   - [ ] Review middleware error logs
   - [ ] Assess user impact

2. **Immediate Response**:
   - [ ] Verify security headers in production
   - [ ] Check middleware configuration
   - [ ] Review recent deployments
   - [ ] Implement emergency fixes if needed

3. **Recovery**:
   - [ ] Restore proper header configuration
   - [ ] Test all security headers
   - [ ] Update monitoring and alerting
   - [ ] Document incident and lessons learned

## Monitoring Setup

### Railway Monitoring

```bash
# Set up Railway monitoring for security headers
railway logs --filter="security"
railway metrics --service=web
```

### Health Check Monitoring

```bash
# Monitor security health endpoint
curl -H "Accept: application/json" https://your-domain.com/api/health/security
```

### Automated Testing Integration

```bash
# Add to CI/CD pipeline
npm run test:security:prod
```
