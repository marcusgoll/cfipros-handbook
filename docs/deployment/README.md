## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### Quick Start

1. **Setup Railway Project**

   ```bash
   railway login
   railway init
   ```

2. **Add PostgreSQL Service**
   - Railway Dashboard → Add Service → Database → PostgreSQL

3. **Configure Environment Variables**

   ```bash
   CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=https://...
   ```

4. **Deploy**

   ```bash
   railway up
   # Or connect GitHub repository for automatic deployments
   ```

5. **Verify Deployment**

   ```bash
   npm run test:railway
   ```

### Environment Variables Required

#### Essential for Production

```bash
# Authentication
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...                    # SENSITIVE
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...

# Database (automatically provided by Railway)
DATABASE_URL=${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}

# Monitoring
NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=https://...

# Application URL (automatically set)
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=${{RAILWAY_STATIC_URL}}
```

#### Optional but Recommended

```bash
# Analytics
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY=phc_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST=https://us.i.posthog.com

# Security
ARCJET_KEY=ajkey_...

# Logging
BETTER_STACK_SOURCE_TOKEN=...
```
