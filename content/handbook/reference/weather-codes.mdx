3. **Real-time updates** - PIREP evaluation
4. **Alternate planning** - Weather trend analysis

### Decision Making

**Go/No-Go Decisions:**

- Compare actual vs. forecast conditions
- Analyze trend information
- Consider pilot experience level
- Evaluate alternate options

### Teaching Weather Codes

**For Flight Instructors:**

- Start with basic METAR components
- Progress to TAF interpretation
- Emphasize PIREP importance
- Practice with real weather data

## Quick Reference Cards

### METAR Quick Decode

1. **Station + Time**: Who, when
2. **Wind**: Direction and speed
3. **Visibility**: How far can you see
4. **Weather**: What's happening now
5. **Clouds**: Coverage and height
6. **Temperature**: Current conditions
7. **Altimeter**: Pressure setting

### TAF Quick Decode

1. **Valid period**: When forecast applies
2. **Base conditions**: Initial forecast
3. **Change groups**: When conditions change
4. **Probability**: Likelihood of conditions
5. **Temporary**: Short-term variations

## Common Mistakes

### Interpretation Errors

1. **Confusing UTC vs. local time**
2. **Misreading cloud heights** (hundreds of feet)
3. **Ignoring trend information**
4. **Overlooking remarks section**
5. **Misunderstanding visibility restrictions**

### Planning Errors

1. **Using outdated weather**
2. **Ignoring PIREP information**
3. **Inadequate alternate analysis**
4. **Underestimating weather changes**
